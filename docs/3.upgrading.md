### From v1.x (Filament v3) to v4.x (Filament v4)

With Filament v4 it has been recommended for plugin authors to have the users include their plugins views in a custom theme, rather than include the built css from the plugin. So for upgrades from Filament v3 to v4 it is recommended to follow these instructions from [Filament Docs](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme) to set up a custom theme (if not already done) and add this to your theme/app css file

```css
@source '../../../../vendor/defstudio/filament-searchable-input/resources/**/*.blade.php';
```
